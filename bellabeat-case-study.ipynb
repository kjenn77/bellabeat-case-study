    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "* Occasional users tend to be less active compared to Daily users. Therefore, there is an opportunity to provide incentives or motivation for Occasional users to be more active.\n",

    "### <span style=\"color: #5A9BDC;\">5.4. User Activity - Daily Usage</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** A daily step count of 7,000 is recommended as it can provide additional health benefits for some conditions, such as heart disease. Further details can be found [here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2025-07-25/step-count-7000-health-benefit/105571904).  \n",

    "**Observations:**\n",
    "* On average, the recommended 7,000 daily step count is achieved on all days except Sunday which has an average daily step count of 6,641.\n",
    "* Saturday has the highest average daily step count of 7,831.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "* There is an opportunity to challenge users to use the product more often by providing incentives for users to also be active on Sundays.\n",

    "* The average Step Count dips at hours 11:00 and 15:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "<u> Peak Hours: </u>\n",
    "* Hour 08:00 - this peak would most likely be due to users commuting into work.\n",
    "* Hour 12:00 - this peak would most likely be due to users walking around during their lunch break.\n",
    "* Hour 19:00 - this peak would most likely be due to users commuting back home. As the average Step Count for this hour is higher than at 08:00, users may also be walking to a restaurant for dinner (taking a detour), or exercising at a gym before heading home.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> Trough Hours: </u>\n",
    "* Hour 11:00 - this dip would most likely be due to users getting work done at their desk before their lunch break or due to low energy levels prior to eating lunch.\n",
    "* Hour 15:00 this dip would again most likely be due to users busy with work and low energy levels after a meal.\n",
    "* As such, there is an opportunity to remind or incentivise users to get some movement during these hours.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:**\n",
    "* There is a positive relationship between Steps taken and Calories burned (i.e. more steps taken in a day would often result in higher calories burned).\n",
    "* Daily Users have a stronger Steps vs Calories relationship compared to Regular Users (trendling gradient of 0.079 vs 0.050, respectively).\n",
    "* Occasional Users was removed due to insufficient data and being unable to draw conclusions from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "* This positive relationship between Steps taken and Calories burned can be used to motivate users to be more active if their goal is to lose weight.\n",
    "* As Daily Users tend to burn more Calories per Steps taken compared to Regular Users, this can be used to motivate users to be more active and use their device more regularly.\n",

    "**Observations:**\n",
    "* Very Active Minutes has the strongest relationship with Calories burned with a trendline gradient of 14.67.\n",
    "* Fair Active Minutes has the second strongest relationship with Calories burned with a trendline gradient of 4.98.\n",
    "* Light Active Minutes appears to have no significant relationship with Calories burned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "* For users with a goal to lose weight, there is an opportunity to provide motivation or incentive to be \"Very Active\" as this tends to burn more Calories.\n",
    "* Similarly, there is an opportunity to motivate or incentivise users to be active with more intensity to move from \"Light\" activity to \"Fair\" activity to burn Calories."
